## LinkedIn Algorithm Deep Dive

### Primary Data Source
Richard van der Blom's Algorithm Insights 2024 Report (5th Edition) — analysis of **1.5 million posts** from 34,000 profiles across 50+ countries.

### Core Ranking Factors

| Factor | Weight | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Dwell Time** | #1 Factor | Time spent reading = primary signal |
| **Comments** | 15x likes | Quality of discussion matters |
| **Shares** | 5x reposts | Original commentary valued |
| **Click "See More"** | Strong signal | Indicates content interest |

### Content Format Performance (Reach Multipliers)

| Format | 2024 Multiplier | Change from 2023 |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Polls** | 1.64x | +24% |
| **Document/Carousel** | 1.45x | -1% |
| **Video** | Moderate | Below carousel |
| **Text + Image** | Baseline | 48% of all posts |

### The "Golden Hour" System

```
Post Published
    ↓
First 60 minutes: CRITICAL
    ↓
Strong engagement → Shown to 2nd/3rd degree connections
Weak engagement → Limited to inner circle only
```

**Key Insight**: Posts getting strong first-hour interaction perform 20% better overall.

### Comment Algorithm Specifics

| Comment Type | Impact |
|--------------|--------|
| 15+ word comments | Highest weight |
| Author replies to comments | 30% engagement lift |
| Comments from same company | 15% LESS growth |
| AI-generated comments | Detected and penalized |

### Engagement Timing Strategy

```
Hour 0: Publish post
Hour 1: Comment on 5+ other posts (increases your visibility)
Hour 1: Reply to all comments on your post
Hour 6: Add value-adding comment to your own post
Hour 12: Repeat engagement boost
```

**Warning**: Commenting on your own post FIRST harms reach. Wait for others.

### LinkedIn Hook Formula (First 3 Lines)

Analysis of 8 million+ viral posts reveals 5 winning patterns:

1. **Contrarian Statement**: "Most LinkedIn advice actually hurts your visibility."
2. **Shared Frustration**: "We've all been in that meeting where..."
3. **Raw Personal Share**: "I got fired last Tuesday."
4. **Irresistible Promise**: "Here's exactly how I got 10,000 followers in 30 days."
5. **Result First**: "I turned down a $500K offer. Here's why."

**Technical Insight**: Posts with sentences under 12 words perform 20% better.

### Carousel/Document Best Practices

| Spec | Optimal |
|------|---------|
| Dimensions | 1080 x 1350 px (4:5) |
| Slides | 5-15 (max 300 allowed) |
| Font - Headers | 24pt minimum |
| Font - Body | 18pt minimum |
| Format | PDF only |
| Dwell time potential | 2-3 minutes (vs 15-30 sec for text) |

**Key Stat**: Carousels get **5x more clicks** than any other format.

### What Kills Your Reach

| Penalty | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| External links in post | Significant reach reduction |
| Engagement pods detected | ~30% reduced growth |
| More than 3-5 hashtags | Diminishing returns |
| Likes from same company | 15% less growth |
| "Engagement bait" tactics | Actively suppressed |

**Note**: Hashtags are nearly irrelevant in 2024. Hashtag pages were disabled October 2024.

### Best Posting Times

| Day | Optimal Times |
|-----|---------------|
| Tuesday | 8-10 AM, 4 PM |
| Wednesday | 2 PM |
| Thursday | 4 PM |
| Friday | 11 AM - 3 PM |

**Worst Days**: Saturday, Sunday, Monday

### Followers vs Connections

- Connections see ~10-15% of your posts
- Followers see ~25-30% of your posts
- **Implication**: Build followers, not just connections

## YouTube Algorithm Deep Dive

### Core Ranking Factors

| Factor | Priority | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Watch Time** | #1 | Total minutes watched |
| **Audience Retention** | #2 | % of video watched |
| **Click-Through Rate (CTR)** | #3 | Thumbnail + title effectiveness |
| **Engagement** | #4 | Likes, comments, shares |
| **Session Time** | #5 | Does viewer stay on YouTube? |

**Critical Stat**: YouTube's recommendation algorithm drives **70% of all views**.

### Audience Retention Benchmarks (2025 Data)

| Metric | Benchmark |
|--------|-----------|
| Average retention | 23.7% |
| Top 17% of videos | 50%+ retention |
| First minute drop-off | 55% of viewers leave |
| Mid-video dip | 40-60% of video duration |

### Retention Graph Patterns

| Pattern | Meaning | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Spike** | Viewers rewatching | Create more moments like this |
| **Dip** | Viewers skipping/leaving | Analyze and fix this section |
| **Flat Line** | Consistent engagement | Gold standard - maintain this |
| **Bump after dip** | Viewers skipping to find content | Consider restructuring |

**Algorithm Impact**: 10% retention improvement → 25%+ increase in impressions

### Thumbnail Psychology (CTR Optimization)

| Element | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Human faces | Immediate attention capture |
| Strong emotions | Surprise, shock, joy perform best |
| Expressive close-ups | Outperform neutral faces |
| 3-5 words text | Maximum for readability |
| High contrast colors | Stand out in feed |
| Mobile optimization | 70%+ views are mobile |

**Mistake to Avoid**: High CTR + low retention = algorithm penalty (misleading content signal)

### YouTube Chapters (Timestamps)

**SEO Benefits**:
- Appear in Google search results as "Key Moments"
- Direct links to specific video sections
- Additional keyword opportunities

**Requirements**:
- First timestamp MUST be 0:00
- Minimum 3 timestamps
- Minimum 10 seconds per chapter
- 120 character limit per chapter title

### YouTube Shorts vs Long-Form (Different Algorithms)

| Metric | Long-Form | Shorts |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Primary signal | Watch time + CTR | Views vs swipes |
| Ideal retention | High % watched | Loops/rewatches |
| Watch histories | Separate from Shorts | Separate from Long-Form |
| Optimal length | Varies by content | 40-60 seconds best |

**March 2024 Change**: Every Short loop = 1 view (no minimum watch time)

**Key Insight**: Shorts and long-form have SEPARATE watch histories. Shorts don't help long-form recommendations.

### End Screen Best Practices

| Element | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Duration | Last 5-20 seconds |
| Elements | 2-3 maximum (avoid clutter) |
| Promoted video | Choose highest-converting |
| Subscribe button | Add text like "Join Our Community" |
| Visual cues | Point to where elements appear |

## Instagram Algorithm Deep Dive

### Core Ranking Factors (Confirmed by Adam Mosseri, January 2025)

| Factor | Priority | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Watch Time** | #1 | How long people watch Reels |
| **Likes per Reach** | #2 | Engagement rate matters |
| **DM Shares** | #3 | Strongest signal for new audiences |

**Stat**: 694,000 Reels are sent via DM every minute.

### Connected vs Unconnected Reach

| Reach Type | Primary Signal |
|------------|----------------|
| Connected (followers) | Likes weighted more |
| Unconnected (non-followers) | Shares weighted more |

### The Critical First 3 Seconds

**Data Points**:
- 50% of viewers drop off in first 3 seconds
- Average Reel watch time: only 3 seconds
- 60%+ 3-second hold rate = 5-10x more reach than 40% hold rate

**Hook Tactics That Work**:
- 72% of viral Reels use storytelling hooks or jump cuts in first 3 seconds
- Faces in first 3 seconds = 35% higher retention
- Bold text overlays + unexpected visuals = 83% of viral Reels
- Humor + CTA + motion in first 3 seconds = 38% higher hook rate

### Completion Rate by Length

| Length | Completion Rate |
|--------|-----------------|
| Under 15 seconds | 72% |
| 15-60 seconds | 46% |
| Over 60 seconds | 36% |

### Instagram Carousel Performance (2024)

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Average engagement rate | 10.15% (highest of any format) |
| vs Single image | 1.4x wider reach, 3.1x higher engagement |
| Optimal slides | 8-10 slides |
| "Swipe" CTA in caption | Improves engagement from 1.8% to 2% |
| Save rate | 2x higher than Reels |

**Algorithm Insight**: Carousels boost session duration by 27% (swiping = extended engagement).

### Shadowban Triggers (Reduced Reach)

| Trigger | Risk Level |
|---------|------------|
| Banned/restricted hashtags | High |
| Bot/automation usage | High |
| Mass follow/unfollow | High |
| Engagement pods | Moderate |
| Repetitive content/captions | Moderate |
| TikTok watermarks | Moderate |
| Sudden engagement spikes | Moderate |
| Copyrighted audio | Moderate |

**Detection Test**: Post with unique hashtag, have 5 non-followers search for it. If not found in 5 minutes = likely shadowbanned.

**Duration**: Most shadowbans last 3-14 days.

### April 2024 Algorithm Update: Original Content Priority

- Reposted content now replaced with original creator's post
- "Serial reposters" (10+ reposts in 30 days) excluded from Explore/recommendations
- Original creators get notifications when their content replaces reposts

### December 2024: Trial Reels

New feature allowing creators to test Reels with non-followers only before sharing to main audience.

## TikTok Algorithm Deep Dive

### Algorithm Structure (Reverse-Engineered)

TikTok uses **three interconnected layers**, not one algorithm:
1. Initial content testing (small audience)
2. Engagement measurement
3. Expansion to larger audiences

### Engagement Point System (Unofficial but Data-Supported)

| Action | Points | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Rewatch/Loop | 10 | Highest value |
| Complete watch | 8 | Strong signal |
| Share | 6 | Distribution signal |
| Comment | 4 | Engagement signal |
| Like | 2 | Lowest positive signal |
| Quick scroll | -1 | Negative signal |

### How Testing Works

```
New Video Published
    ↓
Shown to small group (~2 hours, primarily followers)
    ↓
Algorithm measures: watch time, completion, engagement
    ↓
Pass test → "Medium" audience
    ↓
Continue performing → Potential viral distribution
```

**Key Insight**: Follower count doesn't affect algorithmic ranking. New accounts can go viral.

### 2024 Algorithm Shifts

| Change | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Niche authority > broad viral | Find your community |
| Retention optimization prioritized | Completion rate critical |
| 60-180 second videos optimal | 43.2% more views than shorter |
| Under 30 seconds disadvantaged | Unless exceptional hook-to-payoff |
| Past 90 days viewing = 74% of FYP | History heavily weighted |
| Last 7 days = 40% of immediate recs | Recent behavior matters most |

### Watch Time & Loops

- Every loop = additional view (counts toward metrics)
- Looping content = strong engagement signal
- 70%+ completion + 15%+ engagement in first hour = significant boost

**Loop Strategy**: Create videos where ending seamlessly transitions to beginning.

### TikTok SEO (Platform as Search Engine)

TikTok now functions like a search engine:
- Keywords in captions matter
- On-screen text is indexed
- Hashtags still relevant (unlike LinkedIn)
- Subtitles/captions boost discoverability

**Stat**: Videos with captions receive 67% more engagement.

### Posting Frequency & Timing

| Recommendation | Source |
|----------------|--------|
| 1-4 times daily | TikTok Official |
| 2-5 times weekly | Buffer (sustainable) |
| 4-6 times weekly | HubSpot survey |

**Best Days**: Tuesday, Thursday, Friday

**Best Times**:
- Monday: 5 PM
- Tuesday: 10 AM - 1 PM
- Wednesday: 4-6 PM
- Thursday: 7-9 AM
- Friday: 4-6 PM
- Saturday: 10 AM - 7 PM

**Warning**: Don't post back-to-back. Space videos by several hours to avoid self-competition.

### Content Creation Best Practices

| Tactic | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Native content (created in-app) | Algorithm preference |
| Trending sounds (early adoption) | Discovery boost |
| Reply to comments in first hour | Engagement signal |
| On-screen text/captions | 67% more engagement |
| 70-80% of users watch muted | Captions essential |

## Email/Newsletter Algorithm Deep Dive

### Gmail/Yahoo 2024 Requirements (Mandatory for Bulk Senders)

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| SPF, DKIM, DMARC | Authentication required |
| Spam rate | Must stay below 0.3% (ideally 0.1%) |
| One-click unsubscribe | Required in header |
| Opt-out processing | Within 2 days |

**Penalty**: Failure to comply = inbox filtering or rejection.

### Inbox Placement Statistics

| Metric | 2024 Data |
|--------|-----------|
| Global inbox placement | ~84% average |
| Gmail inbox placement | 87.2% (Q4 2024) |
| Emails never reaching inbox | 1 in 6 (16.9%) |

### How Gmail's Algorithm Works

Gmail tracks:
- Opens, clicks, replies, forwards
- Time spent reading
- Scrolling behavior
- Star/archive actions
- Delete-before-open behavior
- Spam marking patterns

**Key Insight**: Tracking pixels = 15% more likely to be flagged as spam.

### Subject Line Optimization

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| 6-10 words | 21% open rate (highest) |
| 61-70 characters | 43.38% open rate |
| Numbers in subject | +57% open rate |
| Recipient name | +20% open rate |
| Word "newsletter" | -18.7% open rate |
| ALL CAPS | Sent to spam |

**Stat**: 47% of recipients decide to open based on subject line alone.

### Subject Line Formulas That Work

1. **How-To**: "How to [achieve desired outcome]"
2. **Numbered List**: "7 ways to [benefit]"
3. **Scarcity**: "Last chance: [offer ending]"
4. **Question**: "Are you making this [mistake]?"
5. **Personalized**: "[Name], here's your [thing]"

### Deliverability Best Practices

| Practice | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Warm up new domains gradually | Avoids spam triggers |
| Target 90-day engaged users | Improves sender reputation |
| Custom preheader text | 22.58% more opens |
| Personal sender name | 3.81% higher open rate |
| DMARC set to "quarantine" or "reject" | One company went from 77% to 94% inbox placement |

## Substack Algorithm Deep Dive

### How Notes Discovery Works

Notes can be discovered by:
1. Your subscribers/followers
2. Subscribers of people who engage with your Notes
3. Algorithmically shown to anyone who may like it

### What the Algorithm Optimizes For

| Signal | Priority |
|--------|----------|
| Subscriptions | High |
| Paid conversions | High |
| Engagement (likes/comments) | Lower than subscriptions |
| Time spent | Not primary focus |

**Key Insight**: The app delivers more than 1/3 of all paid subscriptions on the platform.

### Content Longevity

Unlike most social networks, Substack Notes can continue reaching new users **days or weeks** after posting — especially if content is evergreen or emotionally resonant.

### Restacking Impact

Restacking = Substack's version of resharing
- Increases reach
- Signals engagement to algorithm
- Frequently restacked notes = higher discovery
- Profile more likely to be recommended to new users

### January 2024: Notes "Woke Up"

Notes became an actual lead generator starting January 2024. Before that, it was essentially a ghost town despite launching in early 2023.

**Content Trend**: Dominated by posts about writing, social media, and Substack itself.

| **Chrome Data** | Browsing behavior influences rankings |
| **Twiddlers** | Manual overrides applied after algorithm |
| **E-E-A-T Scoring** | Systematically measured (author entity recognition) |
| **Query Deserves Freshness** | Newer content gets boost for certain queries |

### Implications for Content Creators

1. **Clicks matter** — Not just rankings, but actual click behavior
2. **Site authority is real** — Build domain reputation
3. **Author entities tracked** — Build personal brand
4. **Freshness signals** — Update content regularly
5. **User behavior from Chrome** — Engagement beyond the page matters

**Caveat**: Documents don't show feature weights — only that features exist.
